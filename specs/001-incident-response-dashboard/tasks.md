# Tasks: AI Incident Response Orchestrator Dashboard

**Revised for PRD v2.0** (persistent alert strip + Now/Performance/Knowledge tabs, replacing two
stacked bands). FR numbers match spec.md's post-re-spec numbering (FR-001–FR-121). Phase 1 (Setup)
was completed against v1.0 and is untouched by this revision — no scaffolding it produced is
affected by the IA change. Every phase from Foundational onward is regenerated.

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-incident-response-dashboard/`
**Prerequisites**: [plan.md](./plan.md), [spec.md](./spec.md), [research.md](./research.md),
[data-model.md](./data-model.md), [component-inventory.md](./component-inventory.md),
[contracts/](./contracts/), [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md)

**Tests**: MANDATORY (Constitution Principle XII). Every user story phase writes its tests first;
implementation follows. `[REQ]` on every task cites the PRD requirement ID(s) spec.md attached to
the functional requirement(s) it satisfies — the FR number itself appears in the description text
for a direct spec.md lookup.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] [REQ] Description`

- **[P]**: different file, no dependency on an incomplete task in this list
- **[Story]**: `US1`/`US2`/`US3`/`US4`/`US5` — omitted for Setup, Foundational, and Polish
- **[REQ]**: PRD requirement ID(s) or §11 criterion, per Constitution Principle II

## Path Conventions

React SPA, single project (plan.md → Project Structure): `src/components/`, `src/domain/`,
`src/api/`, `src/state/` at repository root; component/unit tests colocated as `*.test.ts(x)`;
Playwright specs under `tests/e2e/`.

---

## Phase 1: Setup — COMPLETE (unaffected by PRD v2.0)

**Purpose**: Scaffold the project. Completed against v1.0; nothing here is IA-specific.

- [X] T001 Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript-strict project (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`,
      `tsconfig.json` with `strict: true`, `noImplicitAny: true`) at repo root (research.md §1)
- [X] T002 [P] Configure ESLint + Prettier for TS/React, forbidding `any` (constitution Technology
      Constraints) in `eslint.config.js`
- [X] T003 [P] Configure Vitest sharing Vite's config + RTL setup file in `vitest.config.ts` /
      `tests/setupTests.ts` (research.md §5)
- [X] T004 [P] Configure Playwright (`playwright.config.ts`, `tests/e2e/`) (research.md §6)
- [X] T005 [P] Install and scaffold MSW: `src/api/fixtures/browser.ts` (`setupWorker`) and
      `src/api/fixtures/server.ts` (`setupServer`) (research.md §7)
- [X] T006 Create directory skeleton: `src/components/{layout,kpi,approvals,incidents,charts,
      shared}/`, `src/domain/`, `src/api/{dashboard,incidents,approvals}/`, `src/api/fixtures/
      handlers/`, `src/state/`, `tests/e2e/` (plan.md → Project Structure)
- [X] T007 [P] Add `dev`/`build`/`test`/`test:e2e`/`typecheck`/`lint` scripts to `package.json`
      (quickstart.md)

**Checkpoint**: Done. `npm run dev`/`test`/`test:e2e`/`typecheck`/`lint`/`build` all verified green.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Infrastructure every user story's panels depend on — now including the alert strip and
the tab shell, which PRD v2 itself calls load-bearing for every decision after it ("Build the strip
in phase 1, not phase 5"). US2's queue is reachable via the strip's button (FR-011), and every
story's content lives inside a `TabPanel`, so both are genuine cross-story dependencies, not just
US1's concern.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Blocks all user stories.

- [ ] T008 Define shared types in `src/api/types.ts` mirroring data-model.md's ten entities
      (including the new `KnowledgeEmbedding`) and the expanded `Incident.status` enum
      (`OPEN`/`ESCALATED`/`INVESTIGATING`/`MITIGATED`/`RESOLVED`/`CLOSED`); mark `[INFERRED]`/`[GAP]`
      fields with a code comment pointing back to data-model.md
- [ ] T009 [P] Build the seeded fixture dataset in `src/api/fixtures/seededDataset.ts` from the
      PRD's own numbers (funnel: 142/98/87/79/71/68; breakdown counts; ~1,284 knowledge chunks
      across 4+ document types; ≥10 team-wide `developer_feedback` rows so the feedback-impact
      widget renders by default per the mock's own "12 corrections · team 61" figures — see FR-077)
      (research.md §7)
- [ ] T010 Create the MSW handler barrel `src/api/fixtures/handlers/index.ts` (starts empty; each
      story phase appends its own handler module here)
- [ ] T011 Wire MSW worker registration into `src/main.tsx`, dev-mode only (research.md §7)
- [ ] T012 [P] Implement `src/api/client.ts`: typed `fetch` wrapper (base URL, JSON parsing, error
      normalization) — the only place `fetch` appears (constitution Technology Constraints)
- [ ] T013 [P] [REQ Principle III] Implement `src/domain/clock.ts`: a `Clock` interface + a
      system-clock implementation, injected everywhere else in `domain/` — never `Date.now()`
      called directly outside this file
- [ ] T014 [P] [REQ Principle III,XII] Unit test for `domain/clock.ts` (default vs. injected
      clock) in `src/domain/clock.test.ts`
- [ ] T015 [P] [REQ PRD §3B,§B1,§B4 / FR-025,FR-026] Implement `src/domain/filters.ts`: pure
      functions for "at most one active filter across all tabs, selecting a new one replaces the
      old" and "clear a filter without disturbing global filters or navigating tabs" (FR-024)
- [ ] T016 [P] [REQ FR-025,FR-026,FR-024] Unit test for `domain/filters.ts` (replace-not-accumulate;
      clear leaves time range/env/service/search untouched and does not change the active tab) in
      `src/domain/filters.test.ts`
- [ ] T017 [REQ PRD §4,§7,TB-2 / FR-001,FR-002,FR-003,FR-004,FR-005,FR-017,FR-059] Implement `src/state/useUrlState.ts`:
      typed hook over `URLSearchParams` + `history.replaceState` exposing tab/time
      range/env/service/search/includeResolved/drill-down/`incident` (internal id), built on
      `domain/filters.ts`; an unrecognized `tab` value falls back to `now` (FR-017) (research.md §2)
- [ ] T018 [REQ TB-5,§11.17 / FR-005,FR-017,FR-020,FR-059,SC-010] Test for `useUrlState`
      round-trip (set → serialize → parse restores identical state, including tab; bad tab value
      falls back to `now`) **and** that changing the tab param in isolation leaves time
      range/env/service/search/includeResolved/drill-down untouched, in both switch directions
      (FR-020) — in `src/state/useUrlState.test.ts`
- [ ] T019 [P] Implement `src/state/queryClient.ts`: TanStack `QueryClient` with shared defaults
      (retry, `staleTime`) (research.md §3)
- [ ] T020 [P] [REQ AR-8,FR-119,FR-121 / Assumption 10,12] Implement `src/state/
      OperatorContext.tsx`: React Context + `localStorage`-backed operator name, plus the
      configurable low-confidence threshold (default 0.70) — scaffold only; the
      prompt-blocks-until-supplied behavior (FR-120) is wired in US2, where attribution first
      matters
- [ ] T021 [REQ FR-119,FR-121] Unit test for `OperatorContext` (localStorage persistence,
      change-name) in `src/state/OperatorContext.test.tsx`
- [ ] T022 [P] [REQ Principle VII / FR-105,FR-106] Implement `src/components/shared/
      PanelBoundary.tsx`: error boundary + the four-state switch (loading skeleton /
      empty-no-data / empty-filtered / inline retryable error)
- [ ] T023 [REQ FR-105,FR-106,Principle VIII] Component test for `PanelBoundary`'s four states and
      that its failure doesn't propagate outward, in `src/components/shared/PanelBoundary.test.tsx`
- [ ] T024 [P] [REQ Principle VII stale rule / FR-107] Implement `src/components/shared/
      StaleBanner.tsx`: "Last updated Nm ago — reconnecting"
- [ ] T025 [P] [REQ X-5 / FR-110 / Assumption 9] Implement `src/components/shared/
      RelativeTime.tsx`: relative by default, absolute + timezone on hover
- [ ] T026 [REQ X-5,FR-110] Unit test for `RelativeTime` formatting with an injected clock in
      `src/components/shared/RelativeTime.test.tsx`
- [ ] T027 [P] [REQ AR-2 / FR-034,FR-111] Implement `src/components/shared/ConfidenceBar.tsx`:
      bar + numeric value + low-confidence qualifier, reading the threshold from `OperatorContext`
- [ ] T028 [P] [REQ AR-1,A11Y-1 / FR-033,FR-111] Implement `src/components/shared/
      PriorityPill.tsx`, `StatusPill.tsx` (covering the full v2.0 status enum, including
      `INVESTIGATING`/`MITIGATED`), `RiskBadge.tsx`, `OutcomeBadge.tsx` — every one renders a text
      label alongside colour, never colour alone
- [ ] T029 [REQ A11Y-1,A11Y-2] Component tests for all four pill/badge components (text label
      present, including the two new status values; contrast-safe class applied) in
      `src/components/shared/*Pill*.test.tsx` and `*Badge*.test.tsx`
- [ ] T030 [P] [REQ A11Y-3] Implement `src/state/useFocusTrap.ts`: cycles Tab/Shift+Tab within a
      container ref, restores focus to the triggering element on close (research.md §9)
- [ ] T031 [REQ A11Y-3] Unit test for `useFocusTrap` (cycling, restore-on-close) in
      `src/state/useFocusTrap.test.ts`
- [ ] T032 [P] [REQ A11Y-4] Implement `src/components/shared/AccessibleChartTable.tsx`: renders a
      domain-computed series as a table, visibly toggled
- [ ] T033 [REQ A11Y-4] Component test for `AccessibleChartTable` toggle + table content in
      `src/components/shared/AccessibleChartTable.test.tsx`
- [ ] T034 [P] [REQ AS-1,AS-2,AS-3,AS-4,AS-5,AS-6,AS-7,AS-8,X-2 / FR-007,FR-008,FR-009,FR-010,FR-011,FR-012,FR-013,FR-014,FR-015] Implement `src/api/dashboard/alertStrip.ts` +
      `src/components/layout/AlertStrip.tsx`: own TanStack Query (`GET /api/dashboard/alert-strip`,
      30s `refetchInterval` unconditional on tab visibility per research.md §12), `hot`/`warm`/
      `calm` states, the calm resting message (FR-010), `role="status"`/`aria-live="polite"`
      (FR-013), both counts clickable (FR-011) via `useUrlState`
- [ ] T035 [REQ AS-1,AS-2,AS-3,AS-4,AS-5,AS-6,AS-7,AS-8,§11.11,§11.13 / FR-007,FR-008,FR-009,FR-010,FR-011,FR-012,FR-013,FR-014,FR-015] Component test for `AlertStrip`: all three
      severity states, the calm message rendered instead of disappearing, both buttons route
      correctly without changing the strip's own counts, `aria-live="polite"` not `assertive`, in
      `src/components/layout/AlertStrip.test.tsx`
- [ ] T036 [P] MSW handler for `GET /api/dashboard/alert-strip` in `src/api/fixtures/handlers/
      alertStrip.ts`
- [ ] T037 [P] [REQ TB-1,TB-2,TB-3 / FR-016,FR-017,FR-018] Implement `src/components/layout/TabBar.tsx`:
      `role="tablist"`/`role="tab"`/`aria-selected`, roving-tabindex arrow-key navigation, tab
      state via `useUrlState`, Now's badge hidden at zero (FR-018)
- [ ] T038 [REQ TB-1,TB-2,TB-3,A11Y-3,§11.14,§11.18 / FR-016,FR-017,FR-018] Component test for `TabBar`:
      arrow-key navigation, ARIA roles, badge hidden at zero (never "0"), URL round-trip, in
      `src/components/layout/TabBar.test.tsx`
- [ ] T039 [P] [REQ TB-4 / FR-019] Implement `src/components/layout/TabPanel.tsx`: always mounted,
      visibility toggled via the native `hidden` attribute — never conditional rendering
      (research.md §11)
- [ ] T040 [REQ TB-4 / FR-019] Test confirming a hidden `TabPanel`'s content is excluded from the
      accessibility tree and tab order (via the `hidden` attribute) in
      `src/components/layout/TabPanel.test.tsx`
- [ ] T041 Implement `src/App.tsx`: mounts `QueryClientProvider`, `OperatorContext.Provider`,
      `AlertStrip` (outside any `TabPanel`), `TabBar`, and the three `TabPanel`s
- [ ] T042 [P] [REQ PRD §4 / FR-001,FR-002,FR-003,FR-004,FR-006] Implement `src/components/layout/
      DashboardHeader.tsx`: title, environment multi-select, service dropdown (all-services
      default), time-range segmented control with the FR-004 tooltip ("applies to Performance/
      Knowledge only"), live indicator + manual refresh — all wired to `useUrlState`
- [ ] T043 [REQ FR-001,FR-002,FR-003,FR-004,FR-006] Component test for `DashboardHeader` (each
      control, including the service dropdown, updates URL state correctly; tooltip present on the
      time-range control) in `src/components/layout/DashboardHeader.test.tsx`
- [ ] T044 Implement `src/main.tsx`: entry point mounting `App` inside providers

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready. `npm run dev` shows the alert strip and tab bar with three empty
panels; every shared primitive and hook has a passing unit/component test. User story work can
begin.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Triage without ever losing sight of what's critical (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: The Now tab's four operational tiles, the incident table, and the read-only drawer —
proving the data model end to end, with the alert strip (built in Foundational) already telling the
truth from the moment this story is demoable.

**Independent Test**: Load against the seeded dataset; verify the alert strip's hot/warm/calm state,
the four Now tiles, table filtering/sort/search, row-click-opens-drawer-without-navigation, and URL
round-trip (tab + filters + open incident) on reload (spec.md's own Independent Test).

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Approve or reject an AI-proposed action (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: The human-in-the-loop gate — approve (with a HIGH-risk confirm step) or reject (with a
required reason) a proposed action, watching it resolve in place, with sibling cards immune to each
other's lifecycle (PRD v2 §11 AC-19).

**Independent Test**: Approve a HIGH-risk action through its confirmation step while a second action
executes; confirm the second's timer is undisturbed; reject a third without a reason and confirm
it's refused; double-click Approve and confirm exactly one execution; confirm the queue is reachable
from the alert strip on any tab.

demoable product" per the PRD's own words — now with the alert strip and tab shell already in place
from Foundational.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - See the automation trust argument, with drill-downs that explain themselves (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Performance tab's three automation tiles, the funnel, and execution outcomes, plus the
cross-tab jump mechanism every later drill-down (breakdowns in US5) will reuse.

**Independent Test**: Verify each Performance tile, funnel stage, and outcome count independently;
confirm rolled-back is never folded into success/failure; click a funnel stage and confirm the
dashboard switches to Now, flashes the table, shows a distinctly-styled chip, toasts, and the row
count matches the stage's drop count; confirm clearing the chip stays on Now.

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Find where the AI has nothing to work with, and see the effect of fixing it (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: The Knowledge tab (coverage gaps, documents driving resolutions, documentation
candidates) and the feedback-impact widget — closing the learning loop, per the PRD's own framing
of these two as one phase.

**Independent Test**: Verify the three Knowledge tiles, the coverage-gap ordering and caption, the
documents-driving-resolutions ranking, and the documentation-candidates list with recurrence counts;
verify the feedback-impact widget computes a real percentage, is suppressed under the 10-correction
threshold, and never attributes a decline to the user.

- [ ] T162 [US4] Extend `src/api/fixtures/handlers/incidentsList.ts` to honor `candidate=true`
      (K4) with real `candidateReason`/`recurrenceCount` values from the fixture data
- [ ] T163 [US4] Register the US4 handlers in `src/api/fixtures/handlers/index.ts`

### Components for User Story 4

- [ ] T164 [US4] [REQ K1,P-2] Implement `src/components/kpi/KpiStrip.tsx` (Knowledge variant): one
      TanStack Query against `dashboard/knowledge`'s tiles
- [ ] T165 [US4] [REQ K2] Implement `src/components/charts/CoverageGapsChart.tsx`: hand-rolled
      horizontal bars, ascending, red/amber/green thresholds, auto-caption via `domain/
      coverageGaps.ts`
- [ ] T166 [US4] [REQ K3 / FR-102] Implement `src/components/charts/
      DocumentsDrivingResolutions.tsx`
- [ ] T167 [US4] [REQ K4] Implement `src/components/charts/DocumentationCandidates.tsx`: consumes
      `GET /api/incidents?candidate=true`, reuses `IncidentRow`'s click-opens-drawer behavior
- [ ] T168 [US4] [REQ A11Y-4 / FR-114] Wire `AccessibleChartTable` into `CoverageGapsChart` and
      `DocumentsDrivingResolutions`
- [ ] T169 [US4] [REQ FI-1,FI-2,FI-3,FI-4,FI-5,§11.20 / FR-074,FR-077,FR-078,FR-079] Implement
      `src/components/incidents/FeedbackImpactWidget.tsx`: one TanStack Query against
      `feedback/impact`; renders nothing
      when `suppressed`; static, model-attributed copy on any decline (FR-078); no per-user
      ranking anywhere (FR-079)
- [ ] T170 [US4] [REQ PRD §D7 / FR-073] Implement `src/components/incidents/FeedbackForm.tsx`
      with React Hook Form, listing existing feedback above the form and below
      `FeedbackImpactWidget`

**Checkpoint**: US1–US4 independently functional — PRD §12 phase 4, "closes the learning loop."

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - See volume trends and where incidents concentrate (Priority: P5)

**Goal**: Volume trend with resolution-time overlay and the three breakdown charts, reusing US3's
cross-tab jump machinery rather than rebuilding it.

**Independent Test**: Verify the volume buckets and overlay series and the three breakdowns; verify
clicking any segment produces the same cross-tab jump behaviour as a funnel stage.

### Tests for User Story 5 (MANDATORY — write first) ⚠️

- [ ] T171 [P] [US5] [REQ P4,P5 / FR-095,FR-096,FR-097,FR-098] Contract test for `GET /api/dashboard/breakdowns`
      (volume bucket granularity, top-6+Other, top-5 services) in
      `src/api/dashboard/breakdowns.contract.test.ts`
- [ ] T172 [P] [US5] [REQ P4 / FR-095 / Assumption 4] Component test for `VolumeChart`: day
      buckets for 7d/30d/All, hour buckets for 24h, in
      `src/components/charts/VolumeChart.test.tsx`
- [ ] T173 [P] [US5] [REQ P4 / FR-096] Component test for `VolumeChart`: median-resolution line
      overlaid on a secondary axis, in `src/components/charts/VolumeChart.overlay.test.tsx`
- [ ] T174 [P] [US5] [REQ P5 / FR-097,FR-098] Component test for `BreakdownBars` (all three
      variants): ordering, top-N+Other, inline known-rate, cross-tab jump on click via
      `useCrossTabJump` (built in US3), in `src/components/charts/BreakdownBars.test.tsx`
- [ ] T175 [P] [US5] [REQ SC-004] Playwright e2e: a breakdown-segment click produces the identical
      cross-tab jump sequence (switch, flash, chip, toast) as a funnel-stage click, in
      `tests/e2e/breakdownCrossTabJump.spec.ts`

### Domain for User Story 5

- [ ] T176 [P] [US5] [REQ P4 / FR-095 / Assumption 4] Implement `src/domain/volumeBuckets.ts`:
      bucket granularity selection by active time range

### API + MSW for User Story 5

- [ ] T177 [P] [US5] [REQ FR-095,FR-096,FR-097] Implement `src/api/dashboard/breakdowns.ts`
- [ ] T178 [P] [US5] MSW handler for `GET /api/dashboard/breakdowns` in `src/api/fixtures/
      handlers/dashboardBreakdowns.ts`
- [ ] T179 [US5] Extend `src/api/fixtures/handlers/incidentsList.ts` to honor `breakdown=`
- [ ] T180 [US5] Register the US5 handlers in `src/api/fixtures/handlers/index.ts`

### Components for User Story 5

- [ ] T181 [US5] [REQ P4,P-2 / FR-095,FR-096] Implement `src/components/charts/
      VolumeChart.tsx`: Recharts `ComposedChart`, stacked known/unknown + median-resolve line
- [ ] T182 [US5] [REQ P5 / FR-097,FR-098] Implement `src/components/charts/
      BreakdownBars.tsx` (parameterized for priority/category/service), click → `useCrossTabJump`
- [ ] T183 [US5] [REQ A11Y-4] Wire `AccessibleChartTable` into `VolumeChart` and `BreakdownBars`

**Checkpoint**: All five user stories independently functional — full PRD v2.0 scope (§12 phases
1–5).

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Verification passes that span every story — PRD §12 phase 5's remaining "ship quality"
scope (Knowledge and breakdowns/volume having already absorbed the content PRD v2 explicitly moved
ahead of pure polish).

- [ ] T184 [P] [REQ P-1 / FR-115] Measure first-meaningful-paint against the seeded dataset
      (Lighthouse or equivalent); confirm < 2s
- [ ] T185 [P] [REQ X-2,X-3 / FR-108,FR-109] Verify the alert strip's 30s cadence and Performance/
      Knowledge's 5-minute cadence via each query's `refetchInterval`; confirm animated,
      non-jumping value transitions across every tile/chart
- [ ] T186 [P] [REQ TB-4 / FR-019] Playwright e2e: switching between all three tabs after initial
      load triggers no additional network request for already-loaded panels and no loading
      skeleton, in `tests/e2e/tabSwitchNoRefetch.spec.ts`
- [ ] T187 [P] [REQ §11.12,SC-012,SC-013 / FR-015] Playwright e2e: record the alert strip's counts,
      switch to Performance, seed a new P1, confirm the strip updates within one polling interval
      with no tab switch or manual refresh (SC-013), and confirm the counts read identically
      whichever tab is active except for that update itself (SC-012), in
      `tests/e2e/stripLiveness.spec.ts`
- [ ] T188 [P] [REQ A11Y-2 / FR-112] Run an automated contrast check (e.g. `axe`) across every
      pill/badge and chart series; fix any WCAG AA failure found
- [ ] T189 [P] [REQ A11Y-3,SC-009 / FR-113] Playwright e2e: full keyboard traversal of the tab
      bar, the open drawer (agent trace, similarity matches, actions, timeline, feedback), in
      `tests/e2e/drawerKeyboard.spec.ts`
- [ ] T190 [P] [REQ Principle VIII,SC-011 / FR-106] Playwright e2e: force one panel's MSW handler
      to error (including the alert strip itself) and confirm every other panel stays interactive,
      in `tests/e2e/failureIsolation.spec.ts`
- [ ] T191 [REQ quickstart.md] Walk quickstart.md's 11-step manual golden-path check end-to-end;
      record the result
- [ ] T192 [P] Document `npm run dev`/`test`/`test:e2e` in `README.md` per quickstart.md
- [ ] T193 Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` clean across `src/`; fix any strict-mode or
      lint violation

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: complete
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: depends on Setup — **blocks all user stories**. Now includes the
  alert strip and tab shell, since PRD v2 itself treats both as prerequisites for every later
  decision, and US2 depends on the strip's button existing.
- **User Stories (Phase 3–7)**: all depend on Foundational; mostly independent of each other, with
  two real cross-story dependencies (below), both additive
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: depends on all five user stories

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: no dependency on US2/US3/US4/US5
- **US2 (P2)**: builds `ApprovalCard` independently of US1, but its final task (T115) wires into
  US1's `ActionsAndExecutions.tsx` — additive, US1 works with or without it
- **US3 (P3)**: no dependency on US1/US2/US4; **US5 depends on US3** for `useCrossTabJump`/
  `CrossTabFilterChip`/`CrossTabToast` (built once in US3, reused, not rebuilt)
- **US4 (P4)**: no dependency on US1/US2/US3/US5 — Knowledge's own charts (K2/K3) are not
  drill-down targets, so US4 needs none of US3's cross-tab machinery
- **US5 (P5)**: depends on US3 (see above); otherwise independent

### The shared-file caveats

- Every story's last task registers its MSW handlers into `src/api/fixtures/handlers/index.ts`
  (T072, T107, T135, T163, T180) — one-line, low-conflict, sequence if worked in parallel.
- `src/api/fixtures/handlers/incidentsList.ts` gains an additive branch from US1 (base), US3
  (`funnelDropAt`/`funnelStage`/Performance `kpiTile`), US4 (`candidate=true`), and US5
  (`breakdown=`) — four stories touch one file across the project's lifetime, each adding a
  self-contained branch.
- `src/domain/filters.ts` and `src/domain/kpi.ts` are each created in Foundational/US1 and
  **extended** (not recreated) by US3 (T131, T132) — a real but small cross-story file dependency,
  called out explicitly in those tasks' descriptions rather than left implicit.

### Within Each User Story

- Tests are written first and MUST fail before implementation begins (Constitution XII)
- Domain modules before the API layer that composes them
- API + MSW before the components that consume them
- Story complete and independently demoable before moving to the next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Foundational `[P]` tasks run together, respecting the few intra-phase orderings noted (e.g.
  `useUrlState` needs `domain/filters.ts` first; `AlertStrip`'s component task follows its own API
  task)
- Once Foundational is done, **US1, US2, US3, and US4 can all start in parallel** — US5 must wait
  for US3's `useCrossTabJump` to exist
- Within a story, every test task is `[P]` against every other test task in that story

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# All US3 tests together (T116-T129), before any US3 implementation:
Task: "Contract test for GET /api/dashboard/performance in src/api/dashboard/performance.contract.test.ts"
Task: "Unit test for domain/funnel.ts percentage/annotation in src/domain/funnel.test.ts"
Task: "Component test for AutomationFunnel in src/components/charts/AutomationFunnel.test.tsx"
# ...remaining T116-T129

# Cross-tab jump machinery, built once here and reused by US5 (T130, T136, T137):
Task: "Implement src/domain/funnel.ts"
Task: "Implement src/state/useCrossTabJump.ts"
Task: "Implement src/components/shared/CrossTabFilterChip.tsx + CrossTabToast.tsx"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Phase 1: Setup — done
2. Phase 2: Foundational (alert strip + tab shell) — **critical, blocks everything**
3. Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **Stop and validate**: run quickstart.md steps 1–3, 7–8, 11 against the seeded dataset
5. This alone proves the data model end to end *and* that the strip never regresses — PRD §12
   phase 1's own stated rationale for building the strip first, not last

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → foundation ready (strip + tabs already correct)
2. + US1 → demoable read-only dashboard (MVP)
3. + US2 → PRD §12's "coherent, demoable product" (phases 1–2) — the demo moment
4. + US3 → "the trust argument" (phase 3), plus the cross-tab jump machinery
5. + US4 → closes the learning loop (phase 4)
6. + US5 → full PRD scope (phase 5)
7. + Polish → ship quality

### Parallel Team Strategy

Once Foundational is done: one person on US1, US2, and US4 each in parallel; US3 first, then US5
(same person or handed off), since US5 depends on US3's cross-tab jump hook. Coordinate on the
shared-file caveats above.

## Notes

- `[P]` = different file, no dependency on an incomplete task
- `[REQ]` = PRD requirement ID(s)/§11 criterion; every FR number from spec.md appears in at least
  one task's description text for direct spec.md traceability (Constitution Principle II)
- Every component task's Definition of Done includes all four states (Principle VII) and the
  accessibility obligations for that surface (Principle X) — not called out as separate tasks per
  component, since the constitution makes them part of every component's completion
- Full per-component contracts (props/states/events/errors) are written immediately before that
  component's implementation task, per the constitution's Definition of Done item 1 —
  component-inventory.md fixed each component's *identity and classification* at plan time; the
  full contract is this task's first sub-step, not a separate task
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate a story independently before continuing
